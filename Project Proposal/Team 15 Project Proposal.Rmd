details on your project plan.

TEAM INFORMATION (1 point) Team #: 15 Team Members:

1.  Michael Munson (GT Id: mmunson34). I currently work as a product
    development engineer for a company in Minnesota. My educational
    background includes: Physics (BS), Mathematics (BA), Teaching (MAT);
    I am working on my Certificate in Data Science for the Chemical

    standardize and digitize workforce management processes at for our
    airport employees. I have a BS in Industrial & Systems Engineering
    from the University of Florida with a Minor in Statistics (2019). I
    have worked on numerous analytics projects in my current role,
    undergrad studies, and previous ISE internships at Southwest and
    Disney. [Insert background information: Name, professional
    background, education background, previous analytics related
    projects you have worked on]

3.  Jeffrey Sumner (GT Id: jsumner32). I'm a Data Engineer for Southern
    Star Central Gas Pipeline. My background is in Econ, Mathematics and
    Statistics. At Southern Star we have ranged from proof-of-concepts
    to full-fledged data science projects. Some of the things we have
    work on are forecasting revenue, predict whether we are operating
    outside of recommended bounds, performing text analytics on survey
    data, etc. In my spare time, I am the lead data scientist for a
    website that analyzes player tendencies and models win/loss
    probability for a handful of Indie games.

4.  Matthew Royalty (GT Id: mroyalty3). I'm a Data Engineer for Southern
    Star Central Gas Pipeline. I've been in this role for about 5 years
    developing data models and building ETL pipelines for our data
    warehouse initiative. I've, also, helped develop our initial revenue
    forecast. Prior to that, I spent 15 years as a lead software
    engineer working on a customer facing .Net application. I have a BS
    in Computer Science.

# OBJECTIVE/PROBLEM (5 points) Project Title: Background Information on chosen project topic:
March Madness

For many years, sports have not only been a staple of the entertainment business, but also the subject of many analytical techniques.One of the largest annual sporting events in the US is the NCAA March Madness tournament.<insert fact about relative size of the event such as: "which last year boasted a viewership of ... per game on average"> Along with big-time viewership, comes big-time revenue. <Insert fact about revenue, such as: "last year, it was estimated that the total revenue created for the NCAA was..., not to mention other, non-tracked revenue opportunities (betting,...)>

Predicting the outcome of the Men's Division I March Madness Tournament has been considered somewhat a "holy grail" for analytics enthusiasts. How do you predict the outcome of ** games that are played over *** weeks with any certainty? Especially considering potentially having to forecast team upsets, player injuries, ... shifting data.

There are many different analyses that go into predicting outcomes of the match ups. "Live win probabilities" can be calculated on a play-by-play timeframe; often incorporating factors such as: time remaining in the game, score difference, pre-game win probabilities, which team has possession, etc. There is also the "excitement index" which indicates the rate of change of a team's chance of winning over the course of the game. Exciting games can come with boosted viewership. There are also "Elo ratings" which generally rate a team's chances of winning games based on factors like: the location of the game, the team's conference, the type of game (tournament or regular season), etc. There are also many parallels to Elo, including Dr. Joel Sokol's LRMC ratings (found at: https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jsokol/lrmc/).

## Problem Statement (clear and concise statement explaining purpose of your analysis and investigation):

The goal of our project is to create a multiple regression model to predict attendence at games given different match ups between teams and other pre-game characteristics, along with building a logistic model that will predict the outcome of the games.

## State your Primary Research Question (RQ):

Can we predict game attendance and outcome based on pre-game statistics? At what level of accuracy can we predict the outcome of games with the data that is currently available?

## Add some possible Supporting Research Questions (2-4 RQs that support problem statement): 

1.   What is the relationship between team rankings (Massey Ordinal, Elo, AP Polls, etc.) and attendance?

2.   What is the relationship between relative team rankings and likeliness to win?

## Business Justification: (Why is this problem interesting to solve from a business viewpoint? Try to quantify the financial, marketing or operational aspects and implications of this problem, as if you were running a company, non-profit organization, city or government that is encountering this problem.)

Consumer-facing companies with any ad-merch budget are always looking for the most efficient ways of converting people into loyal brand users. The first part of this conversion is brand exposure, where a person becomes aware of the brand's products. March Madness offers companies multiple large-exposure events (tournament games and related content). However, not all games will have the same level of exposure (in this case, game attendance is the proxy for exposure). Predicting the attendance of games beforehand will help companies choose the best placement for their advertisements that will maximize their potential conversion rates.


## DATASET/PLAN FOR DATA (4 points) Data Sources (links, attachments, etc.):

Much of the statistical data can be found at the NCAA website. (https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2013/11/27/ncaa-men-s-basketball-records-books.aspx)

The data can be found as part of a long-running Kaggle competition "Men's March Mania" (link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/data).


## Data Description (describe each of your data sources, include screenshots of a few rows of data):

NCAA Men's Basketball Data:
- Records from 2000, including game attendance, team records per season, week-by-week Associated Press Poll Records
- These records are mostly in .pdf format

The Kaggle "Men's March Mania" datasets include:
- Basic information: Team ID's and Names; Tournament seeds since 1984; final scores of all regular season, tournament games; etc.
- Team Box Scores: game-by-game stats at a team level (free throws, rebounds, turnovers, etc.)
- Geography: the city locations of all games since 2009
- Public Rankings: Weekly team rankings from multiple metrics
- Supplemental Information: Coaches, conference affiliations, bracket structure, etc.


## Key Variables: (which ones will be considered independent and dependent? Are you going to create new variables? What variables do you hypothesize beforehand to be most important?)

For predicting game attendance, team ranking (Elo, Massey Ordinal, AP Polls, etc.), fan base size and game location (distance from team origin) seem to be good independent variables to consider. Regarding the distance from team origin, this data would have to be roughly estimated.


## APPROACH/METHODOLOGY (8 points) Planned Approach (In paragraph(s), describe the approach you will take and what are the models you will try to use? Mention any data transformations that would need to happen. How do you plan to compare your models? How do you plan to train and optimize your model hyper-parameters?))

## Anticipated Conclusions/Hypothesis (what results do you expect, how will you approach lead you to determining the final conclusion of your analysis) Note: At the end of the project, you do not have to be correct or have acceptable accuracy, the purpose is to walk us through an analysis that gives the reader insight into the conclusion regarding your objective/problem statement

## What business decisions will be impacted by the results of your analysis? What could be some benefits?

From the analysis, we hope to be an influential factor when considering advertisement placements. Predicted attendance of games can be used to calculate exposure to advertisements and be used by businesses to maximize their advertising placements.
